## About Me
<img src="https://dannama.com/images/DannaMa.png" class="floatpic">
I am a **Phd Candicate**<br> in the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab, advised by [Prof. Kirstin Petersen](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/members/kirstin-h-petersen/) in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. I received my Master of Engineering Degree in Electrical and Computer at Cornell University in 2018 and Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at National University of Singapore in 2016.


**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking for postdoctoral researcher position for 2025 Fall. If you have any information, please contact me. Thank you!</font>**
