## About Me
<img src="https://www.dannama.com/images/DannaMa.png" class="floatpic">
I am a **Ph.D. Candicate** in the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab, advised by [Prof. Kirstin Petersen](https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/members/kirstin-h-petersen/) in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University in 2018 and my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2016.


**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking for a postdoctoral researcher position for Fall 2025. If you have any information, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!</font>**

## Research Interests

- Physically intelligent robotic swarms
- Emergent behaviors
- Soft sensors and robots


My current focus is on the design and control of physically intelligent robotic swarms, with the goal of understanding and harnessing the complex collective behaviors that arise through local interactions among agents. These swarms can exhibit highly coordinated actions despite individual agents having limited sensing and decision-making capabilities. I am particularly interested in how emergent behaviors—such as synchronization, aggregation, and task allocation—can be achieved through simple rules of interaction.
In my work, I design simple, low-cost soft sensors that are accessible to a wide range of users. I explore the integration of these sensors into robotic systems to enable greater flexibility and adaptability in dynamic environments. By leveraging principles of physical intelligence, I aim to develop robotic swarms that can function both as taskable robotic platforms and as smart materials, all without the need for a centralized controller.
The swarm exhibits emergent behavior, adjusting its collective actions based on local interactions and feedback from the environment. By taking advantage of the distributed nature of this systems, I aim to create robots that are resilient, scalable, and efficient. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop autonomous robotic systems capable of operating effectively in complex, real-world environments.
